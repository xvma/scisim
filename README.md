1 Description of System
On direct draw winders, fiber is wound onto paper or woven sleeves that are installed on rotating collets. Each
winder is equipped with 2 collets that can be interchanged automatically when a full package is reached, while the
strand is transferred from the full collet to the empty collet to allow a continuous process.
In the present process, the full packages are taken from the collets and manipulated on carriers. Empty sleeves are
then installed manually on the empty collet to prepare for the next collet changeover.
In the future, the package handling as well as the re-sleeving shall be automated by a cobot process. While special
processes like winder cleaning and other preparations still will be done by human operators, the package handling
will be done by Doffers and the re-sleeving will be handled by Sleevers.
Several Doffers and Sleevers shall work in parallel next to each other. All Doffers are installed on a common Doffer-
track. All Sleevers are installed on a common Sleever-track.
While Doffers cannot pass Doffers and Sleevers cannot pass Sleevers, it is possible under certain conditions that
Sleevers may pass Doffers.
In the process environment, the parallel production of different product recipes on different winders is likely. To
allow a clean downstream process, the Carriers must be homogenously loaded with packages of identical recipes.
For example, positions 2A01 through 2A03 may produce per recipe “AA” while 2A04 and 2A05 produce per “BB”
parameters. Here, Carriers on position 1 will be dedicated to “AA” packages while Carriers on position 2 to “BB”
packages. The Doffer must take this into account. See Environment overview below for reference.
A Winder can produce multiple packages per collet. 1 – 10 packages are possible in general but this project will be
limited to 1 or 2 packages. All packages are taken in one step by the Doffer and then separated as each Carrier
Hanger can take only a single package.
